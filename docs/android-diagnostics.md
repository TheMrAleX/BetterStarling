# Android diagnostics

Open **Options → Diagnostics** in the title/setup menu or in a running game.
Reports stay on the device; export and sharing are explicit actions.

- **Start / stop performance recording** records one-second summaries of frame,
  CPU and GPU durations, frame phases, slow frames and named CPU/worker stages.
  Samples include memory, thermal data when available, streaming queues, rendering
  counters and the current graphics adapter. It is off by default.
- **Toggle detailed GPU profiling** enables the existing renderer's pass timers.
  The report includes p50/p95/p99/max and completed sample counts from their
  rolling 15-sample window. It adds overhead and requires GPU timestamp support;
  absent timings mean unavailable data, not zero cost. Readback is asynchronous.
- **Export diagnostic ZIP** packages bounded tails of Starling's existing
  `logs/latest.log`, `logs/previous.log` and crash reports, session checkpoints,
  Android exit history and retained performance reports. It uses the same logger
  and panic reporter as the game.
- **Share latest diagnostic ZIP** opens Android's share chooser for that ZIP only.
  It grants read access to that file, never to the app's data folder.

The session checkpoint records startup/menu/world-loading/in-world phases and
memory. A missing clean-exit marker indicates an interrupted process, which can
also be an Android kill or a force stop. It does not by itself prove a crash.
Fatal errors returned through the normal entry point keep that marker unset.

Before resources are installed, the setup's **Diagnostics** button opens a
separate Android window styled with the setup's shared dark palette and Geist
fonts. Its labels are English, matching the setup. It can preview the latest log,
export and share a ZIP, or retry starting the game without initializing the game
renderer. Long-press the launcher icon and choose **Diagnostics** to open it
directly. A failed early startup also routes the next normal launch there.

The startup marker is written before loading the game library and cleared after
its first presented frame. The recovery process leaves the original session and
logs in place; it does not rotate them or start the game to export them. The
window itself does not load the native library; preview/export loads it lazily.
If that library cannot load, the window still opens and displays the error, but
native ZIP export is unavailable.

On Android 11 and newer, `ApplicationExitInfo` can distinguish native/Java crashes,
ANRs, low-memory and other exits. Availability depends on the OS. Up to eight
system traces, at most 1 MiB each, stay in private app storage. Binary native
traces contribute only a bounded crashed-thread summary to the ZIP; register and
memory dumps remain private. No replacement signal handler is installed.

The game library carries a BuildId, and every CI build keeps the same library
unstripped as the `starling-symbols-<abi>` artifact (90 days). To read the
`libhorizon_android.so` frames of a tombstone summary, take the artifact of the
build whose BuildId matches and run, with the NDK's tools:

```sh
llvm-readelf -n libhorizon_android-symbols.so        # its Build ID, to match the summary's
llvm-addr2line -f -C -e libhorizon_android-symbols.so 0x312e71c 0x30b30c4
```

The addresses are the summary's `pc` values. Release libraries have no line
tables, so this names functions, not lines.

Performance JSONL files in private `performance/` are capped at 8 MiB and 30
minutes, with three retained reports and an eight-sample writer queue. Diagnostic
ZIP payloads are capped at 4 MiB, 32 source files and 256 KiB per ordinary input;
three ZIPs are retained. Long JSONL exports retain a complete header and trailing
complete rows; the manifest identifies truncated or omitted inputs.

The exporter excludes account files, worlds and configuration and redacts known
credential/address patterns. Review the resulting archive before sharing because
arbitrary third-party log text cannot be guaranteed free of private data. Nothing
is uploaded automatically. CPU spans nest, worker totals overlap and GPU timings
arrive late: these numbers identify correlations, not proof of lock contention.

This port reuses Horizon Android's existing diagnostics, exit-history, tombstone
and performance recorder code. It adapts them to Starling's logging, streaming
workers, GPU timers, translation keys and in-game settings. It does not add an
automatic backend benchmark, change the selected graphics API or add a 32-bit APK.

Run `python tools/test_android_diagnostics.py` to test the production writers,
exporter, tombstone parser, frame summaries and span aggregation on the host.
Build an ARM64 APK with `python packaging/android/build_apk.py` for device tests.

## Resource installation

Android uses an exclusive kernel file lock for preparation: the Rust standard
library's file locking is unavailable on some Android toolchains. Concurrent
preparation still waits for the same folder; the lock is not skipped.

The installer checks the prepared schema, tables and auxiliary assets, including
sounds, before activating resources. It keeps the previous resource folder until
the new folder is published and restores it if publication fails. Retrying after
a failed load resets the loader generation so the finished installation can reach
the title screen instead of staying at **Starting Starling**.

Starling generates its resource tables with Java exporters on the device. The
older Android fork downloaded pre-generated engine tables instead, so their
preparation times are not directly comparable. Download concurrency alone does
not remove the exporter work. Public source trees and APKs do not contain
Minecraft jars or prepared Minecraft resources.
